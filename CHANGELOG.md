# 0.7.1
* Fix: Added safety check to RBQL that would prevent accidental usage of asignment operator "=" instead of comparison "==" or "===" in JS (In Python this was not possible before the fix due to Python's own syntatic checker).  
* Added "Rainbow CSV" category to all extension commands by [@yozlet](https://github.com/yozlet) request, see [#22](https://github.com/mechatroner/vscode_rainbow_csv/issues/22)
